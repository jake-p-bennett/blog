    "text": "During the 2024-2025 NFL season, The Athletic maintained an NFL projections webpage [INSERT LINK HERE] that contained forecasts for each regular season and playoff game. Each projection included a forecasted points spread, and I was curious to see how these forecasts compared to the Las Vegas spreads and the actual game outcomes. I back-tested a simple betting strategy:\n\nWhen The Athletic’s spread is greater than the Vegas spread, bet on the favorite.\nWhen The Athletic’s spread is less than the Vegas spread, bet on the underdog.\nIf the spreads are the same, do not place a bet."
